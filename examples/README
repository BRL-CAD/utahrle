Some sample RLE images.  Some of these are used in the examples in the
paper in the docs/ directory.

christmas_ball.rle	- A cute ray-traced scene that Rod Bogart used
			  for his Christmas card a few years back.
dart.rle		- A dart, with alpha mask.  Model by John Peterson
			  and Tom McCollough.
mandrill.rle		- The infamous digital monkey.
lenna.rle		- Lenna Sjooblom, Miss November 1972.
			  (No kidding, Rod looked it up.  The first two
			  o's should have dots over them...)
tack_w_shadow.rle	- A tack, for hanging your RLE pictures on the walls.
			  Model by Rod Bogart.
			  This picture turns out to be a good one for
			  catching some pathological cases, as it as a
			  few "extra" scanlines above the "top" of the
			  image (as advertised in the header).  Not
			  sure how this happened.
