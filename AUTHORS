Our thanks to some beta testers (and contributors):
	Eric Haines, 3D Eye
	Gregg Townsend, CS Dept., U of Arizona
	John Peterson, Apple Computer
And to all of you who submitted new programs or ideas for new
features, especially Craig Kolb (Yale), whose 'rayshade' program provided
(indirectly) the incentive for this release.

A special thanks to Martin Friedmann, MIT Media Lab, who almost
totally revamped the 'getx11' program, so that it now works correctly,
and is the most featurful of all the toolkit programs.
